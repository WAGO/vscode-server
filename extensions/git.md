# Git

## Prerequisite&#x20;

VS-Code comes with git source control. We can use this client when connected if we install git on the device. The git installation itself is not covered here.

## Extension

Connect to the device. Press 'explorer' or 'source control' icon to:

* Open folder and init a git repository.
* Clone a repository from Github.

After opening a folder we can not select 'Clone Repository in the 'source control' view anymore. then we have to select 'File -> Close folder'.&#x20;

## Github Pull Request And Issues

With the 'Github Pull Request And Issues' extension we can review and manage GitHub pull requests and issues.&#x20;

## GitHub Repository Manager

With the 'GitHub Repository Manager' we can make, clone and access repositories.
